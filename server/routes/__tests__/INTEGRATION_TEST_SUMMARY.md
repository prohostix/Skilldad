## Total Test Count

**24 integration tests** covering all major workflows and edge cases

## Test Structure

### Setup
- Creates test users (university, instructor, students)
- Creates test course with enrollments
- Generates JWT tokens for authentication
- Mocks Zoom API calls for predictable testing

### Mocked Services
- **Zoom Utils**: `createZoomMeeting`, `generateZoomSignature`, `syncZoomRecordings`, `decryptPasscode`
- **Notification Service**: `sendLiveSessionNotification`
- **Redis**: Rate limiting uses in-memory store
- **Socket Service**: WebSocket notifications are mocked

### Test Data Cleanup
- All test data is cleaned up after each test using `afterEach` hooks
- Ensures tests are independent and can run in any order

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. MongoDB must be running
2. Environment variables must be configured (handled by setup.js)
3. All dependencies must be installed

### Commands

```bash
# Run all integration tests
cd server
npm test -- liveSessionRoutes.integration.test.js

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- liveSessionRoutes.integration.test.js --verbose

# Run with coverage
npm test -- liveSessionRoutes.integration.test.js --coverage

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- liveSessionRoutes.integration.test.js -t "Session Creation"
```

## Test Execution Notes

### Known Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Tests use the existing mongoose connection from server.js
2. **Port Conflicts**: Server may already be running on port 3030
3. **Async Operations**: Some tests wait for background enrollment to complete

### Recommendations
1. Run tests in isolation from the development server
2. Use a separate test database
3. Consider using MongoDB Memory Server for faster test execution
4. Increase timeout for tests that wait for background operations

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests
- When API contracts change
- When new features are added
- When requirements are modified
- When bugs are discovered

### Best Practices
- Keep test data minimal and focused
- Ensure tests are independent
- Mock external services (Zoom API, email, etc.)
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use descriptive test names

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    cd server
    npm test -- liveSessionRoutes.integration.test.js --forceExit
```
